OVERVIEW

Our system is supposed to take request from soldiers and civilians in the war hit zones, who will share their location, the medical supplies they require. The request will contain
 all the needs and their identity which will be needed by the admin for checking the authenticity if the request. If the request is accepted by the admin then it will be forwareded to 
the nearest warehouse of medical supplies. Warehouse contains all the medical supplies and equipment provided by the government. Medical supply centres are set near the war hit zones
which receive the supplies from warehouses through available mode of transports. Drones will be deployed from these locations to the areas which were specified in the requests.


HOW DO WE GET THE REQUESTS??

Since the civilians donot have many modes of communicating so the majority of the requests will be sent by the soldiers. A certain proportion of soldiers of each units will be assigned an id 
 marking them as part of a rescuing unit. These will be the one sending the requests for supplies as and when they see fit. Request will contain the following parameter-

~location- which requires the medical supplies.
~supplies required- items required will be selected from drop down menu.
~urgency- each soldier will decide how urgently the supllies are required.
~login credentials- the id provided to the soldier will be needed to make requests, which will show that they are part of a rescue team not some fraud.
This request will be sent to the nearest medical centre which contains the specified supplies.


MDECIAL SUPPLY CENTRE

After the request is received admin will check th eauthenticity of the request and proceed accordingly.
Trained drone users will deliver the medical supplies with the help of a drone/drones. Drones will be deployed based on their urgency level of the requests if their is a shortage of drones or to ensure efficiency. 


HOW DID WE USE AI IN OUR PROJECT?
All the research for our project was done using 'Perplexity', a chatbot which provides accurate and up-to-date information, drawing upon reliable sources from the internet and citing them for verification.
We used Google AI suite for producing the presentation detailing our project.
Moreover, GPT promts were used for creating the project website base code.
